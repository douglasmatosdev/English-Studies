> ### News: US abortion law - level 1
The US Court stops a limit on the abortion pill Mifepristone.

Other courts set the limits. But the court wants to give the judges more time to think about stopping the limits. Danco Laboratories makes the drug. The company and the Biden government want the court to stop the limit. First, it is important to sort out the case. The court has more people who are against abortion. The government wants to protect Mifepristone against laws from Republican-led states. Doctors often use Mifepristone with another drug called Misoprostol. More than half of all abortions in the US are with medication.
